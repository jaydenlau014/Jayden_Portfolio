My Data Science Portfolio

## [Project 1: Solar Power Generation Forecasting](https://github.com/jaydenlau014/Solar_Power_Generation_Forecasting)
* Create machine learning models that help solar power system operators to predict the solar power generation from PV panels.
* Interpretation of relationship between independent variables (meteorological and environmental factors) and dependent variables (solar power generation).
* Create and compare various machine learning models (polynomial, SVM, KNeighbors, Random Forest, XGBoost, and ANN regressor) that forecasting solar power generation.
* Optimize the machine learning models with GridSearchCV.
* Evaluate the machine learning models using regression evaluation metrics (R-squared, RMSE, MAE).

I was able to find the best machine learning model that forecasts the solar power generation from PV panels, which is Random Forest Regressor.

## [Project 2: Job Change into Data Scientists Prediction](https://github.com/jaydenlau014/Human-Resources-Process-Job) 
* Create machine learning models that help the HR department to predict job change into data scientists.
* Interpretation of relationship between independent variables and dependent variables (job change).
* Create and compare various machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and KNeighbors classifier) that predict job change.
* Optimize the machine learning models with GridSearchCV.
* Evaluate the machine learning models using regression evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1_score).

## [Project 3: Twitter Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/jaydenlau014/Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis)
* Twitter sentiment analysis is the process of using natural language processing, text analysis, and computational techniques to identify and extract subjective information from tweets posted on the social media platform Twitter. 
* The objective of Twitter sentiment analysis is to determine the sentiment, emotion, or opinion expressed in a tweet, whether it is positive, negative, or neutral. 
* This information can be used by businesses, organizations, and individuals to gain insights into public opinions, measure brand reputation, and make informed decisions based on the feedback received.
* Types of model used are Bag of Words Vectorization, LSTM networks, Transformer and Sentiment Intensity Analysis from VADER.
* Evaluate each model using classification evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 score).

## [Project 4: Stock-Market-Seasonality-Analysis](https://github.com/jaydenlau014/Stock-Market-Seasonality-Analysis)
* Analyzing historical stock market data for major companies (Apple, Microsoft, Google, Tesla, Amazon).
* Utilizing Python for data retrieval, financial metric calculations, and analysis.
* Performing weekly and monthly analyses of stock data.
* Creating visually appealing Excel reports for data-driven decision-making.
* Enhancing understanding of stock market trends and performance.
* Developing proficiency in data analysis and visualization techniques.
