My Data Science Portfolio

# [Project 1: Solar Power Generation Forecasting](https://github.com/jaydenlau014/Solar_Power_Generation_Forecasting)
* Create machine learning models that help solar power system operators to predict the solar power generation from PV panels.
* Interpretation of relationship between independent variables (meteorological and environmental factors) and dependent variables (solar power generation).
* Create and compare various machine learning models (polynomial, SVM, KNeighbors, Random Forest, XGBoost, and ANN regressor) that forecasting solar power generation.
* Optimize the machine learning models with GridSearchCV.
* Evaluate the machine learning models using regression evaluation metrics (R-squared, RMSE, MAE).

I was able to find the best machine learning model that forecasts the solar power generation from PV panels, which is Random Forest Regressor.

# [Project 2: Job Change into Data Scientists Prediction](https://github.com/jaydenlau014/Human-Resources-Process-Job) 
* Create machine learning models that help the HR department to predict job change into data scientists.
* Interpretation of relationship between independent variables and dependent variables (job change).
* Create and compare various machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and KNeighbors classifier) that predict job change.
* Optimize the machine learning models with GridSearchCV.
* Evaluate the machine learning models using regression evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1_score).
